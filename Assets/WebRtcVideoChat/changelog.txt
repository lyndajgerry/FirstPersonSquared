Change Log
	
	Changelog will move to https://www.because-why-not.com/webrtc/changelog/ and this file will be removed next update.
	
	0.981   - Documentation updated. Please visit https://www.because-why-not.com/webrtc to find out more
			- Tutorials for signaling server & stun/turn server setup added: https://www.because-why-not.com/webrtc/tutorials-server-side/
			- ICall received new methods to send String & byte[] to one or multiple users using UDP or TCP style channels
			- Android video has been further optimized (full native camera access will come soon)
			- CallApp has a new configuration button allowing users to change resolution and other settings
			- CallApp shows now additional information if the image is clicked once
			- CallApp will now save the last settings (based on the name if its GameObject to still allow multiple instances in one application)
			- extra folder added. These are additional features requested by users and can be used at your own risk.
			- extra VideoInput added. It can be used to stream custom images or from a Unity camera
			- mobile devices won't switch off screen any more of CallApp is used
			- extra OneToMany added. It is an example how to use the IMediaInterface to stream to multiple recives.
			- extra VideoConference added. An example how to create conference calls using ICall interface. 
			- example folder added. It contains several minimal examples to help new users.
			  See more here:https://www.because-why-not.com/webrtc/examples/
			- mac native libraries uses proper bundle format now
			- iOS workaround added. If a phone call ends Unity will turn off sound for all 
			  AudioSources. IosHelper.UnitySetAudioSessionActive can be called after the call ended to switch
			  the Audio back into the correct mode. All AudioSources need to be restarted after it.
			- signaling server contains now a webserver to make testing and use of https://letsencrypt.org/ easier
			 
	
	
	0.98	- iOS support (arm + arm64). Please check the readme.txt for how to build it.
			- Removed log messages / errors appearing with Unity 2017.2
			- C++ side was rewritten entirely replacing all callbacks with a polling based system
			- Using the debugger in Unity should work better now 
			- Video Frames will now be automatically dropped if the Update method isn't called quickly enough (e.g. during a FPS drop)
			- IMediaNetwork is now supported and can be created using UnityCallFactory.Instance.CreateMediaNetwork
				It works similar to WebRTC Network's IBasicNetwork interface but adds audio and video to make broadcasting to 
				audio / video to multiple users easier
			- UnityCallFactory.SetLoudspeakerStatus / GetLoudspeakerStatus added. Mobile devices treat WebRTC calls like regular phone calls
				requring the speakers to be manually turned on.
			- WebGL version was adapted to recent changes in Chrome. The CallEnded event should now be triggered during disconnects due to network failure 
			- CallApp was improved to better support mobile platforms + a new button was added to change SetLoudspeakerStatus
			- Numerous smaller bugfixes and changes based on user reports received in the past few months
