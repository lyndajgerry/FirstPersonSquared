    /// This app is a more complex and realistic version of the MinimalCall example.
    /// Only code not yet mentioned in an earlier example is commented.
    /// It requires two game objects that have both the SimpleCall script attached. 
    /// One is set as sender (Sender ticked) and one set as receiver. 
    /// 
    /// Unlike the MinimalCall it uses a stun server thus it is able to connect via internet.
    /// (assuming router supports it and no filewalls blocks it)
    /// It can also be used with a Unity RawFrame UI element to show the local or remote video.
    /// Note that the video needs to be flipped (Y Scale -1) as Unity stores video upside down
    /// internally and the library avoid flipping it via the CPU to increase performance.
    /// 
    /// You can use this example in two different ways:
    /// * For easy testing make sure to place both sender & receiver gameobject in a single scene.
    ///   During start the receiver will automatically start and wait for an incoming call and
    ///   after a few seconds the sender will start and then connect
    /// * You can also place them in two different scenes and use two different systems. First one 
    ///   starts the scene with the receiver. Then the other can start the scene with the sender.
    ///   They will then connect via network. If you start this on two different systems that
    ///   aren't in the same LAN note that in some cases the firewall or router configuration
    ///   can block a connection. 
    ///   Make sure if you use two projects they have the same name as this is used as an address
    ///   for the two applications to find each other.
